        I'm a full stack developer with a passion to learn new things
        <br />
        <br />
        Within 3 short months I've managed to transform myself into an
        web-developer;
        <br />
        learning 5 different coding languages!
        <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano, working on cars, and
        developing various computer science programs
